Despite his hard life, Benji is extremely loving and loves human contact. We would like to help Benji make a full recovery, but we need your help to do this.Benji needs sponsors to pay for his kennel fees, and also requires urgent medical help to recover from the several health issues that starvation and neglect on the streets for so long on the streets have caused him.Amongst other things, poor Benji has terrible Mange which you can see around his ears mostly, but also inside his nostrils, which causes scars to form and then open and bleed.Poor Benji is starting to put on some weight and show signs of improvement (see videos below 1 week later), we need to make sure this continues.Please if you would like to adopt send us a message, or perhaps you would like to contribute to his kennel and medical fees and sponsor Benji.",Male,90-cover.jpg,90-DSC_0849.jpg  90-DSC_0851.jpg 90-DSC_2504.jpg ,12/03/2017,Available,12/03/2017137,Peaches,Small,4m,"Little Cherry is just a little baby, she was thrown over the shelter gates along with her sister Peaches, unwanted and discarded like rubbish.Both of their paw nails had nail varnish on them?
